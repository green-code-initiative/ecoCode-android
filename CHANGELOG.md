## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Rule EC550/ESOB015: Extraneous Animation should not be used
- Rule EC549/ESOB016: Hardware Acceleration should not be activated by default
- Rule EC533/SGDP001: Google ads consent should be asked 
- EC534/SPRI004: Add rule to avoid use of Tracking Id using TelephonyManager#getDeviceId()

### Changed
- The embedded Groovy language analyzer was reconfigured to scan only `.gradle` files since it is the files we are interested in for
  the Android project configuration rules.
  The associated language is named `Groovy (Gradle)` instead of just `Groovy`.
  Since the plugin does not scan `.groovy` files anymore, it can work with a Groovy scanner on the same SonarQube instance.

### Deleted

- [#80](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-android/issues/80) Delete rule EC5002 (SDK range) since it not in
  the [best practices mobile](https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices-mobile) anymore
- [#88](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-android/issues/88) Delete rule EC5003 (Disable obfuscation) since it not in
  the [best practices mobile](https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices-mobile) anymore
